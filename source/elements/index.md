Elements is an open source collaborative project where we work on a collection of experiments to more rapidly bring technical innovation to Bitcoin.  Elements are features that are proposed and developed in this technical community that in arbitrary combinations can be fashioned into sidechains.

## Current Elements
These are the features under currently under investigation as part of the Alpha dev sidechain.

#### [Confidential Transactions](/elements/confidential-transactions)
The Confidential Transactions Element keeps the amounts transferred in a
blockchain-backed transaction visible only to participants in that transaction,
while still guaranteeing that no more coins can be spent than are available in a
cryptographic way.
