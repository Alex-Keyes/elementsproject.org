Elements is an open source collaborative project where we work on a collection of experiments to more rapidly bring technical innovation to Bitcoin.  Elements are features that are proposed and developed in this technical community that in arbitrary combinations can be fashioned into sidechains.

## Current Elements
These are the features under currently under investigation as part of the Alpha dev sidechain.

#### [Confidential Transactions](/elements/confidential-transactions)

#### [Segregated Witness](/elements/segregated-witness)

#### [Relative Lock Time](/elements/relative-lock-time)

#### [Schnorr Signature Validation](/elements/schnorr-signatures)

#### [New opcodes](/elements/opcodes)

#### [Signature Covers Value](/elements/signature-covers-value)

#### [Deterministic Pegs](/elements/deterministic-pegs)

#### [Signed blocks](/elements/signed-blocks)

## Proposed Elements
These are some of the features currently under development, but are yet ready for testing in dev sidechain.

#### [Basic Asset Issuance](/elements/asset-issuance)

#### [Bitmask Sighash Modes](/elements/bitmask-sighash-modes)
