### Sidechains are convenient ways to test Elements.

The Elements Project, supported by Blockstream, runs and maintains a number of
sidechains.

## Experimental Sidechains
### [alpha](/sidechains/alpha)
<!-- ### [beta](/sidechains/beta) -->

## Production Sidechains
### [Liquid](/sidechains/liquid)
Run by Blockstream, Liquid is a production sidechain that is secured by
federated consensus rather than proof-of-work.
