### Sidechains are convenient ways to test Elements.

The Elements Project, supported by Blockstream, runs and maintains a number of
sidechains.

## Experimental Chains
### [alpha](/sidechains/alpha)
### [beta](/sidechains/beta)

## Production Chains
### [Liquid](/sidechains/liquid)
Run by Blockstream, Liquid is a production sidechain that is secured by
federated consensus rather than proof-of-work.
