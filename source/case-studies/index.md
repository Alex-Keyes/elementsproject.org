### Liquid, by Blockstream
Blockstream has used several Elements, including [Confidential Transactions](/elements/confidential-transactions) and [Segregated Witness](/elements/segregated-witness), to construct the first commercial sidechain.  The Liquid sidechain offers rapid transfer and settlement between Bitcoin exchanges, bypassing the 10 minute confirmation limit imposed by the Bitcoin blockchain.
