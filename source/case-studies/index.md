            <!-- <p>We're currently prototyping blockchain-based
            systems that track ownership of arbitrary asset classes. While we're
            also working with other technologies that apply asset issuance as a
            protocol on top of a blockchain network like OpenAssets, there are
            features required for some applications that we can only get out of
            native, consensus-enforced asset management.</p> -->
            <p>We use Confidential Transactions for (among other things)
            implementing a subset of the access controls in those systems, and
            having a working implementation of CT (which is compatible with asset
            management) is an huge boon.</p>

### Liquid, by Blockstream
Blockstream has used several Elements, including [Confidential Transactions](/elements/confidential-transactions) and [Segregated Witness](/elements/segregated-witness), to construct the first commercial sidechain.  The Liquid sidechain offers rapid transfer and settlement between Bitcoin exchanges, bypassing the 10 minute confirmation limit imposed by the Bitcoin blockchain.
